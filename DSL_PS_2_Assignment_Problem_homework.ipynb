    "# Delivery Routing Optimization Program Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Delivery Routing Optimization Program is a Python program that solves a delivery routing optimization problem using constraint programming. The program uses the CP-SAT solver from the Google OR-Tools library to find an optimal solution to the problem.\n",
    "Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The delivery routing optimization problem consists of assigning deliveries to vehicles such that each delivery is served by exactly one vehicle, each vehicle serves at most one delivery, and the total distance travelled by the vehicles is within the autonomy or range of the vehicles. The goal is to minimize the impact of the deliveries, which is represented by a matrix of impact values for each delivery-vehicle pair.\n",
    "Program Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Delivery Routing Optimization Program performs the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define the CP model using the cp_model.CpModel() function.\n",
    "- Initialize a timer to track the time taken to solve the problem.\n",
    "- Define the matrix of impact values for each delivery-vehicle pair.\n",
    "- Define the number of vehicles and deliveries.\n",
    "- Define the three groups of vehicles and their respective autonomies or ranges.\n",
    "- Define a list of distances for each delivery.\n",
    "- Define the variables for the CP model using the model.NewIntVar() function.\n",
    "- Define the constraints for the CP model using the model.Add() function.\n",
    "      - Each delivery must be served by exactly one vehicle.\n",
    "      - Each vehicle can have maximum one delivery.\n",
    "      - The total distance travelled by each group of vehicles must be within their respective autonomies or ranges.\n",
    "    - Define the objective function using the model.Minimize() function.\n",
    "    - Solve the CP model using the cp_model.CpSolver() function.\n",
    "    - If an optimal solution is found, print the minimum impact, the assignments of deliveries to vehicles, and the time taken to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wrap-Up\n",
    "\n",
    "The Delivery Routing Optimization Program is a powerful tool for solving delivery routing optimization problems using constraint programming. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for defining the problem and constraints, and it uses the CP-SAT solver to efficiently find an optimal solution to the problem."
